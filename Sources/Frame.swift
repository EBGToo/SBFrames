/// A Frame represents a 3d spatial position and orientation in a cartesian coordinate system.  One
/// frame is designated as the 'base frame'.  Other frames are formed by a translation (by position)
/// and a rotation (by orientation) from a 'parent' frame.  Frames are built upon frames, ultimately
/// recursing back down to the 'base frame'.  [Note: even the 'base frame' has a parent (itself), a
/// position (zero) and an orientation (identity) - this is an implementation convenience to avoid
/// Optional types for `frame`, `position` and `orientation` properties].
///
/// Importantly a `Frame` is a reference type and is mutable, in some limited ways.  The
/// mutability implies that if frame X changes to a different physical location, then all child
/// frames will change physical location too.  For example, a spacecraft has a camera attached to 
/// the spacecraft (mechanical) bus; the camera's lens has a defined boresight.  When the 
/// spacecraft rotates, the boresight (a direction in the camera's frame) changes too - even
/// though neither the direction in camera frame nor the camera frame in the spacecraft frame
/// changed.
///
/// Consider the implication of a Frame implemented as a value type.  All direct children would 
/// point to the same parent but then, if the parent is mutated, all the direct children would
/// point to the original parent.  For the mutated parent to impact the children, every child,
/// themselves value types, would need to be 'reallocated', and so on down the tree.  Any object
/// holding a frame anywhere at or below the mutated parent would hold the original.  It is not
/// a pleasant thought (see SBBasics::Tree for a value type binary tree) to handle updating all 
/// subtree references.
///
/// When implemented as a reference type, referencers will need to 'register' (in a TBD manner) to
/// learn of frame changes.  One expects this to be common - not only does a camera need to know
/// when it's boresight has changed, it also needs to know when an asteroid has moved (and would be
/// registering for the asteriod's frame changes too).

// NOTE: The position and orientation of a FRAME needs to be writeable.  For
// example, a Spacecraft has a frame which defines the coordinate system for
// all spacecraft devices.  Each device will define their own coordinate system
// with a parent given by the spacecraft's frame.  When the spacecraft moves,
// the physical coordinate system of the spacecraft changes.  If an SBFrame
// is immutable then the spacecraft's frame could be changed but then all the
// attached devices would a) still reference the old frame or b) all need to be
// updated to the changed frame - that at least if one needed to transform from
// the device to coordiates 'above' the spacecraft (like planets, stars, etc).
// As it stands a frame does not maintain an association with its children and
// thus option 'b' - updating all referencing frames with the next frame - is
// practically impossible.  The other option is to make SBFrame properties for
// POSITION and ORIENTATION writeable.
//
// If a FRAME's POSITION and ORIENTATION are writeable then changes would need
// to be monitorable.  Thus, for example, a star tracker could compute the ever
// changing direction of the sun so as to avoid staring into the light.  And, of
// course, on change, any cached FrameTransform data would need to be flushed.
//


// Type: Rectangular, Spherical, Cylindrical, etc.
//   => Created POSITION, ORIENTATION off of FRAME must be of the correct type.


// MORE DISCUSSION

// Every frame has a position and an orientation - for the 'base frame' they are 'zero'
//   No, the position itself has a 'frame' even if zero.  If user accesses that frame, then the
//   user now has a frame w/o a position.
//
// Base frame has no parent, no position, no orientation.  THERE IS NO OTHER POSSIBILITY
//   (at least if position, orientation will have a frame)
//
// What is the coordindate system for a base frame: rectangular, spherical, cylindrical?


// ============================================================================================== //
//
// Imagine:
//   a well-defined base frame
//   a sun expressed in the base-frame
//   a moving spacecraft in the base-frame
//   a camera on the spacecraft with a frame relative to the spacecraft's and a view direction
//     (assume the camera and/or the camera's frame listens to spacecraft motion and will close
//      a shutter if the camera's view 'hits' the sun)
//
// The spacecraft moves:
//   The sun itself didn't move, but the postion/orientation relative to the spacecraft did.
//   The camera moved - it is attached to the spacecraft
//     The angle between the camera's direction and the sun changed.
//
// Key Question // Design Issue
//
//  Q-1-A: Is the frame of the spacecraft modified (spacecraft reference to the frame is unchanged
//    but the frame's position and orientation changed)
//
//  Q-1-B: Is the spacecraft's frame changed (perhaps a frame is immutable (value semantics); the
//    spacecraft has a newly allocated frame)
//  Analysis: the camera registered with the spacecraft; the camera knows it is mounted on the
//    spacecraft with a fixed (parameterized) position/orientation offet.  The camera, like the
//    spacecraft has it's own frame.  On callback, the camera frame is changed as:
//      cFrame2 = Frame(scFrame2, Postion(scFrame2, fixedOffset), Orientation(scFrame2, fixedOffset)
//        where fixedOffset are the 'hard numbers' relative to the original scFrame1
//    On callback, the view direcion is updated
//    With new direction, the angle between view and sun is measured; shutter is closed if needed.
//
//  Q-2: The spacecraft has a 'reference frame' with reference semantics; a 'coordinate system'
//     has value semantics?

//  Q-3: A Position is 'Framed'; a Spacecraft is 'Framed' - that does not seem correct as they are
//    vastly different conceptually.  Position vs Point?  Point expressed with different positions
//    depending on coordinate system.  Point moves -> all positions changed.
//      Point -> Position
//      Line -> Direction
//      Body -> Frame (position + orientation)
//
//  Q-4: Race Condition: Two objects a camera and a thruster on the spacecraft; camera is
//    interested in thruster plume.  Spacecraft moves (position+orientation); camera and thruster
//    are updated (somehow, see Q-1), camera computes plume impact.
//  Answer-ish: If reference semantics, when spacecraft moves, both camera and thruster
//    'instantaneously' have different positions/orientations (relative to some third frame). If
//    value semantics, camera and thruster frames need to be updated and only then computed.
//
//  Q-5: Sun moves.  Spacecraft registered as 'interested'; updates computed properties.  Does the
//    Sun notify (should be) or does the Sun's frame notify the S/C frame (can't be)?
//
//  Q-6: Updating Race Condition - A Frame is having it's Postion + Orientation updated, any
//    subframe may perform a computation using its 'half updated' parent...  Unless updates are
//    atomic.
//
//    Frame notifies listeners of its replacement?  Listeners assign the replacement as the new
//    parent?  [Listeners need to be sure they are not between computations using the parent -
//    which gets changed during the computations.]
//
//    New frame allocated as (parent: new, position: old, orientation: old) - no, old position and
//    orientation will point to old frame.
//
//
